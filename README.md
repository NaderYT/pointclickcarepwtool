A Self Service Password Reset Tool For PointClickCare

This is a side project that I am working on to help people who use PointClickCare regularly easily reset their passwords. The idea is simple: have a way
four users to verify who they are and be able to easily reset their password. Each instance of this application would have 3 other instances attatched.
An Owner view, an admin view, and a user view. Still working out what each of these is going to include, but below I have some of the general ideas of what
which type of user is going to be able to do. If there are any suggestions, please feel free to contribute, I am only a beginner in programming and learning
as I go! Thank you!



Owner Role: 
  -Check logs of who has used the tool
  -All other perms
  
  
 Admin:
  -See users accosiated with the facility they are at and help them reset their passwords
  -All User perms
  
 User: 
  -Reset their passwords and only theirs
